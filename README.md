# B0_sim-mapping

### First steps
## Downloads
To recreate all the simulations make sure to download: 
* https://github.com/evaalonsoortiz/Fourier-based-field-estimation.git and add it to your MATLAB path using [startup.m](https://github.com/evaalonsoortiz/B0_sim-mapping/blob/clean-rep/startup.m)

* The modified data for the Zubal phantom. The simulation is not using the raw data from [Zubal phantom](https://noodle.med.yale.edu/zubal/info.htm). Make sure to download the right one from *Eva Alonso Ortiz*


## Start-up
A script named _startup.m is given. Run it to automatically add the different files to your matlab path
